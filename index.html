<!-- BLOCK ELMENT -->
<!-- 	1. A BLOCK level element, by default, takes up all teh sapce to the right
	and to tehleft possible, internal to it's parent
	2. It CAN have a height and a width
	3. NOTHING can ever be on either side (internal to the parent) because it's
	100%. If you change the width, it will just add margin. Blocks will ignore
	margin you add, because they are 100%
	4. If you cahnge the size, it will still take up 100% (at least), but the rest outside of the wide, will just be more margin -->
	<!-- 5. Can be > 100% -->

<!-- 		Inline Elements
		1. Respect left and right padding, left and right margin
		but will ignore top and bottom
		2. Couldn't care less what is left or right. 
		3. With a few exceptions (namely images) you CANNOT tell an inline
		element how big to be.
		4. Will happily ignore all block level rules unless forced to do so -->

<!-- 		Inline block
		1. Can have stuff on eitehr side (inline positive)
		2. Can have height/width (block positive)
		3. Can have top/bottom padding/margin (block positive)
